## _Object Oriented Programming for Software Students_

My name is Charles Carter, I'm currently a student at Southwest Technical College in Cedar City, Utah.
The course I'm taking is Software Development, in which I'm learning to use Java to create applications.
The purpose of this repository is to learn how to use version control with GitHub to complete assignments
given by the class.

### Files contained in this repository

Currently the only significant file is the README.md which is part of the assignment to learn how to properly
use markdown.   


### Personal Bio:

I've always been a fan of computers growing up, especially since I've been a video game fan since being very little.
The computer has always been an amazing tool for gaming, fun, and creativity for me.   I use mine all the time to
create art.   I'm hoping to branch out into computer science and software creation to be able to work with the thing
I feel I'm most familiar with.   In addition to feeling like I'm working in an area I feel comfortable in, I'd like
to someday be able to create my own video games as a hobby.   I've done it before with more limited game-creation
engines and am excited to branch out and have the ability to create things that are more custom and niche to whatever
project I end up working on.


### Goals for the future and why I'm taking this program:
I'm taking this program because computer science was one of the first things I studied for a brief time in my first
year of college.   I'm getting back into it because I saw the success of a sibling to be able to work in the same
field.    I currently work at the public library in the city, I live in but have wanted to move out of that job
where I'm interacting with the public in a customer-service style manner and more of a creative manner.   I think
my people skills will serve me well in working with teams and customers in a software development career.

I would like to work on games, that's actually what my sibling does, but am willing to accept whatever opportunity
comes, as well as create my own  projects for possible income in the future.    Games are appealing to me because
I already create artwork that is similar to video game artwork in pixel art style, as well as it being my favorite
hobby to play video games when I have time.

I have plans to continue learning programming languages so that I will be able to create applications for whatever
hardware platform seems the most appropriate for whatever program I may find myself working on.
